# EmotBot

This project intends to showcase my 
[emotion detection ML API](https://github.com/caspinprince/emotion-detection) 
as a discord bot. Currently, the bot can:

* Post the incoming message data to the API 
to get the predicted emotion.
  
* Respond with a suitable emoji 

* Save emotion data to a SQLite database for later use

* Display number of messages of each emotion for each user in the server
